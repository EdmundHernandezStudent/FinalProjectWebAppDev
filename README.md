Dice Game Proposal
By Parker Dierkens, Claudia Fuentes, Edmund Hernandez, Michael Stitt
The final project idea our team is creating is a single player dice game. This game
places the player against the computer in a one versus one to see who rolls the higher
combined total after rolling two dice. This simplistic game is mainly used to pass the
time similar to games like 2048, hangman, and tic-tac-toe. The website will comprise
two different pages. The first page will have a table showing the names of each player,
each dice roll result, and the combined total for each player. The total column will show
the result of the game by the color. The winner’s number shows up as green while the
loser’s number will be red. Both numbers show up gray in the result of a tie. There will
be two buttons: one will roll the dice, the other will take you to page two.
The second page will show a table with the results of past games played. The table will
hold statistics for total rolls for each player and the winner of each game. Next to the
table there will be a button taking the user back to the first page. The scoreboard
updates with all new games played since the scoreboard was last checked. All games
played are saved into the database each time the “roll dice” button is pressed.
Flexboxes will be utilized for formatting on both pages for the game and scoreboard
respectively.
